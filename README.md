# Force Multiplier

### The goal of Force Multiplier is to turn every human worker into a supervisor.

Most workers today need to produce some sort of artifact (e.g. code, legal contract, documentation, essay, etc.)

It takes human workers a relatively long time to produce the artifact. When a draft of the artifact is produced, it is presented to a supervisor who provides feedback.
The worker then takes the supervisor's feedback and modifies the artifact iteratively until the supervisor is satisfied.

The supervisor's job of examining the artifact and providing feedback can be done much faster than the worker's job of producing and modifying the artifact.

LLMs are orders of magnitude faster than humans at producing artifacts. Therefore, let's replace human workers with an LLM. We only wish to supervise!

### Worker -> Supervisor

Using Force Multiplier, we all become supervisors. Force Multiplier allows us to iteratively provide feedback, with AI modifying the artifact until we are completely satisfied with the result.

### Efficiency

Force Multiplier only modifies the portions of your artifact that require modification, given your feedback. The rest of the artifact remains unchanged. This allows for fast iteration because it's not necessary to wait for the LLM to regenerate the entire artifact after each piece of feedback.

### Core Functionality

Force Multiplier allows you to input any block of text as your initial document. You can then provide your feedback on this document, in terms of specific changes or overall sentiment. The AI Assistant will take your feedback, interpret it, and then propose modifications to the document in a structured JSON format.

The modifications are detailed in terms of the starting and ending words of the blocks of text that need to be replaced, as well as the proposed replacement text. It's designed to cater to multiple modifications at once, enabling you to refine your document in an iterative manner, leading to a more polished output.

### Applications

The practical applications of Force Multiplier are vast. Whether you're working on a business report, drafting a novel, editing an article, or even refining legal contracts, Force Multiplier can be a vital tool in your editing process. It's designed to be domain-agnostic, ensuring that it can understand and modify text from any field or subject matter.

The power of Force Multiplier lies in its ability to understand context, interpret user feedback, and propose meaningful changes. This ensures that you're always in control while also benefiting from the speed, accuracy, and tireless work ethic of a machine learning model. It's like having an ever-present editing partner at your fingertips, ready to help you bring your writing to the next level.

The name of this project – Force Multiplier – truly embodies its mission. It's not just about automating text editing. It's about enhancing your capabilities, multiplying your output, and ultimately, helping you create better written content with less effort.
